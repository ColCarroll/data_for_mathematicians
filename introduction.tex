\section{Introduction}
I've been working as an analytics developer for nearly two years now, and wanted 
to share the most helpful things I've learned in my transition from academia.

First, there are a dizzying number of tools and techniques to learn.  The general
framework I want to cover is:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Setting up and navigating a development environment from the command line 
    (I use \href{https://www.apple.com/osx/}{OSX} and 
    \href{http://www.ubuntu.com/}{Ubuntu})
  \item Scripting with 
  \href{http://www.python.org/}{python} 
  and 
    \href{http://www.r-project.org/}{R},
  \item Saving and sharing work with \href{http://git-scm.com/}{git} 
    and \href{https://github.com/}{github}, and
  \item Storing and accessing data via databases and sql
\end{enumerate}

This will be opinionated, in that I'll typically present what I do as the right way 
to do things. Obviously there are other ways of doing things.

& in-place? & stable? & worst & average & best & remarks\\

Selection & $\times$ & & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $N$ exchanges \\
Insertion & $\times$ & $\times$ & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $\frac{N^2}{4}$ & $N$ & Use for small $N$ or partially ordered \\
Shell & $\times$ &  & ? & ? & $N$ & Tight code, subquadratic \\
Quick & $\times$ & & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $2N \ln N$ & $N \lg N$ & $N \log N$ probabilistic guarantee fastest in practice \\
3-way quick & $\times$ & & $\frac{N^2}{2}$ & $2N \ln N$ & $N$ & Improves quicksort in presence of duplicate keys \\
Merge& & $\times$ & $N \lg N$ & $N \lg N$ & $N \lg N$ & $N \log N$ guarantee, stable \\
Heap& $\times$ & & $2 N \lg N$ & $2 N \lg N$ & $N \lg N$ & $N \log N$ guarantee, in-place \\

\begin{description}
\item[in-place] This concerns memory usage: an in-place sort does not use a 
second array to do the sort.

\item[stable] This concerns composed sorts: if we had an array 
\code{[(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1)]} which is already sorted with 
respect to the first element in each tuple, an algorithm is stable
if it guarantees that sorting with respect to the second key will
return \code{[(a, 1), (b, 1), (a, 2)]}, instead of moving \code{(b, 1)}
to the front.
\end{description}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Selection Sort}

We iterate through the array, find the next smallest, and move that to the start
of the list.

\subsection{Insertion Sort}

At each step along the array, we compare an entry with the neighbor to its left,
and exchange the two if they are out of order.

\subsection{Shell Sort}
Like insertion sort, but use different gap sequences: perhaps compare each
element with the neighbor 7 to its left first, then use a gap of 3, and 
finally 1.  Wikipedia 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort#Gap_sequences}{reports}
that a practical gap of $\lceil \frac{9^k - 4^k}{5 \cdot 4^{k - 1}} \rceil$,
which looks like $1, 4, 9, 20, 46, 103, \ldots$, is good. I have no intuition
for why.

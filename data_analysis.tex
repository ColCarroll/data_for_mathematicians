\section{Introduction}
I've been working as an analytics developer for nearly two years now, and wanted 
to share the most helpful things I've learned in my transition from academia.

First, there are a dizzying number of tools and techniques to learn.  The general
framework I want to cover is:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Setting up and navigating a development environment from the command line 
    (I use \href{https://www.apple.com/osx/}{OSX} and 
    \href{http://www.ubuntu.com/}{Ubuntu})
  \item Scripting with 
  \href{http://www.python.org/}{python} 
  and 
    \href{http://www.r-project.org/}{R},
  \item Saving and sharing work with \href{http://git-scm.com/}{git} 
    and \href{https://github.com/}{github}, and
  \item Storing and accessing data via databases and sql
\end{enumerate}

This will be opinionated, in that I'll typically present what I do as the right way 
to do things. Obviously there are other ways of doing things.

\section{Before You Start}
We'll be moving mostly without a mouse. It is terrible at first, but pays dividends.
If you are using Ubuntu you can get to a terminal with \code{ctrl+alt+T}. On OSX,
use \code{cmd + space} to open spotlight, type in ``terminal'', then hit 
enter. I'll give some pointers to the most important commands to 
know in the terminal. Some important ones to start:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \bash{ls} lists the files in the current directory
  \item \bash{cd directory} changes your directory to \code{directory}
    (if it exists).
  \item The up/down keys scroll through recent commands
  \item \code{tab} will autocomplete when it can. Sometimes you need to 
    hit it twice and it will give you options
  \item \code{ctrl+r} Gives you reverse search in the terminal, letting 
    you type in a few letters. Hitting \code{ctrl+r} more scrolls 
    backwards in these options, and \code{ctrl+g} cancel your search.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Setting up and navigating a development environment from the command 
  line}
If you can use an Ubuntu box, it will be much easier to set everything up, but 
it isn't terrible on OS X, either. In general, the better you can find your 
question on \href{http://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow}, the better you'll do
longterm, so check there early and often if you run into trouble.

We'll be using a few different terminals, and when you are meant to actively 
type something, I will try to copy the prompt: bash (my terminal) uses 
\bash{}, Python uses \py{} and R uses \R{}. Code with no prefix will be a 
\code{message printed back to you}.

Go to the appropriate section to set up your own environment for general 
purpose processing.
\subsection{Ubuntu}
We'll be using Ubuntu 12.04.  On Ubuntu, you get the 
\href{https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/apt-get.html}{Advanced Packaging Tool},
which we invoke with \bash{apt-get}.  We'll install a 
few other utilities off the bat:
\begin{description}
  \item[Get git] Start with\bash{sudo apt-get install git}.
Typing \bash{git} should now output something reasonable. Bad news if you see 
\code{-bash: git: command not found}, and you'll have to do some research to fix
this. 
  \item[Get python]Already built in -- I'd just use theirs.
  \item[Get R] We want 3.0.2, and for this we need to add their repository 
  before we can \code{apt-get} R. Check out 
  \href{http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README}{this page} for 
  good information.
\end{description}

\subsection{OSX}
\begin{description}
  \item[Get Homebrew.] Instead of \code{apt-get}, we'll use 
  \href{http://brew.sh/}{Homebrew}. OS X ships with ruby, so you should be able 
  to copy/paste the command at the Homebrew website with no problem.
  \item[Get git] Now we can run
  \bash{brew install git}.  Typing \bash{git} should now output something 
  reasonable. Bad news if you see \code{-bash: git: command not found},
  and you'll have to do some \href{http://stackoverflow.com}{research}
  to fix this. 
  \item[Get python] Python is already built into OS X (open your terminal and 
  type \bash{python} to start hacking away), but you want a different version of
  Python.  Luckily, this is nice \bash{brew install python}.  This will install 
  Python 2.7.6, which is what we'll be using. 
  There are many discussions about Python 2 vs Python 3.  We follow the advice of
  \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11938786/new-project-python-2-or-python-3}{this one},
  and use Python2 while writing code that will be Python3 compatible.  The main 
  differences are that division is no longer integer division (in python2, 
  \py{3/4 = 0}, in python3 \py{3/4 = 0.75} but \py{3//4 = 0}), more objects are
  \href{http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/}{generators},
  and the \code{print} function is invoked like a function. Python 3.4 was just 
  released, but \bash{brew install python3} will still install Python 3.3.3. Use
  at your own (minimal) risk.
  \item[Get R] As usual, \bash{brew install R} installs a good version of R 
  (I am on 3.0.2).
\end{description}

\subsection{Python Interpreter Hello World}
Open your terminal, type \bash{python} and then \py{print("Hello, World!")}.

That's a bit too easy. Let's instead run
\begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (v2.7.5:ab05e7dd2788, May 13 2013, 13:18:45) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = "Hello, World!"
>>> print(x)
Hello, World!
>>> print(x + x)
Hello, World!Hello, World!
>>> print(5 * x)
Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!
>>> print(5 * (x + "\n"))
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that you can assign strings to a variable, and manipulate strings using 
addition in multiplication (and it works in a sane fashion).  The \code{\textbackslash n}
string is a newline.  The other useful character to know for now is 
\code{\textbackslash t}, which is a tab.
To quit the console, \code{ctrl+d} or \py{quit()}.  

\subsection{R Interpreter Hello World}
Happily, we may again type \bash{R}, and \R{print("Hello, World!")}.
We can't run exactly the same session as we did in Python, since R doesn't let us
mix algebra and strings quite as nicely, but there are equivalents.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
$ R

R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing"

'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

> x <- "Hello, World!"
> print(x)
[1] "Hello, World!"
> print(paste(x,x))
[1] "Hello, World! Hello, World!"
> print(paste(rep(x, 5), collapse=""))
[1] "Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!Hello, World!"
> cat(paste(rep(x, 5), collapse="\n"))
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!> 
\end{lstlisting}
A few things to note about this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We use the \code{paste} function to concatenate strings.
\item The \code{rep(x, 5)} created a vector with five copies of \code{x}. We 
  could have done this by hand with \R{c(x, x, x, x, x)}.  More on R vectors
  later.
\item The \code{paste} function accepts a \code{collapse} argument, which tells 
  it how to join a vector of strings.
\item In the last command, we used \code{cat} instead of \code{paste}.  The
  \code{paste} function would print ``\textbackslash n'', while the \code{cat} function
  interprets these as newlines.  
\item The \code{cat} function doesn't automatically put a newline after it 
  does its thing, which is why the interpreter starts typing after the last
  ``Hello, World!''
\end{enumerate}


\section{Tools for using R}

R has some fantastic support for getting up and working quickly and easily.  A 
few ways to help get hacking:

\begin{description}
\item[Defining variables.] R uses the symbol \code{<-} instead of \code{=}.  
  Using \code{=} will still work (see 
  \href{http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html}{this article}
  if you're interested), but it is typically reserved for setting function
  arguments.
\item[Using Packages]  You can import R code in a number of ways.  I just use
  \R{require(ggplot2)} to import, for example, ggplot2.  You could also use
  \R{library(ggplot2)}, with 
  \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5595512/what-is-the-difference-between-require-and-library}{almost identical}
  results.  If I am importing a local file, use 
  \R{source('../relative/path/to/myfile.R')}.  Note that with this, you can run
  code, assign values to variables, and define functions.  A good workflow
  is to have an interactive console open, figure out how to make R do what
  you want to do, copy that over to a file, and \code{source} the file.
\item[Installing Packages.] A great strength of R is that it has some cutting
  edge packages available.  These are uploaded to CRAN, the ``Comprehensive
  R Archive Network'', which is ``a network of ftp and web servers around the 
  world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for
  R''.  The majority of packages you'll want are installed
  via \R{install.packages("ggplot2")}.  You'll be asked to choose a mirror, 
  and typically the best will be the 
  \href{http://blog.rstudio.org/2013/06/10/rstudio-cran-mirror/}{cloud mirror}
  that RStudio maintains on an Amazon EC2 instance -- number 0.  It syncs
  with the central CRAN mirror in Austria once a day, and is typically beats
  any other mirror for speed (in Austin, the cloud mirror is faster than using
  the mirror in Dallas). 

  Occasionally, you'll want something really cutting edge that you find on 
  github.  There's a nice package from 
  \href{had.co.nz}{Hadley Wickham} that makes this easy:

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
  > require(devtools)
  Loading required package: devtools
  > install_github('ggplot2')

  \end{lstlisting}
  Note the use of \R{sessionInfo()} at the end to view all the attached
  packages and their versions.


\item[Getting help.] It is notoriously difficult to google for help with 
  R, given its name (though, really, who hasn't come up with unexpected 
  results while searching for help with \LaTeX, Python, or Ruby?  I've even
  heard a story of a trip to manpages.com in search of bash help.) The built-in
  R help pages are accessed via \code{?}, and are actually quite helpful.

  Note that \code{?} will only search packages which are currently loaded.  
  Try the following session:

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
  > ?geom_point
  No documentation for ‘geom_point’ in specified packages and libraries:
  you could try ‘??geom_point’
  > require(ggplot2)
  Loading required package: ggplot2
  > ?geom_point 
  \end{lstlisting}

  The suggestion to use \code{??} is also a good one: when I type it in, I see

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
  Help files with alias or concept or title
  matching ‘geom_point’ using regular
  expression matching:


  ggplot2::geom_point
                 Points, as for a scatterplot
  ggplot2::geom_pointrange
                 An interval represented by a
                 vertical line, with a point
                 in the middle.


  Type '?PKG::FOO' to inspect entries
  'PKG::FOO', or 'TYPE?PKG::FOO' for entries
  like 'PKG::FOO-TYPE'.




  (END) 
  \end{lstlisting}
  This command has searched through all \emph{installed}, not necessarily loaded,
  packages.  If you see a sweet function on a blog post and want to find which 
  package it is in, you need to either go to google,
  \href{http://www.rseek.org/}{RSeek},
  \href{http://crantastic.org/}{crantastic},
  or use the \code{sos} package:

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=bash]
  > install.packages('sos')
